As a static site generator, it gives me full control with minimal complexity â€” perfect for a portfolio-blog hybrid. Itâ€™s easy to configure and maintain, making it ideal for logging my projects and growth without distractions.\nOne of my favorite features is Hugoâ€™s built-in responsiveness â€” it automatically adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices without me having to fuss with extra CSS or plugins. On top of that, it handles dynamic media and loads quickly across platforms.\nFor the theme, I picked Blowfish for its clean aesthetic and structure. It keeps the focus on content while giving me flexibility to style it the way I want. Iâ€™m building around a Slate-inspired color palette to reflect both the professional and technical edge of cybersecurity â€” sleek, dark, and focused.\nThis post marks the foundation of Lugo Labs â€” the platform Iâ€™ll use to share everything I break, build, and learn.\n","date":"10 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"www.lugo-labs.com/blogs/act-0-the-set-up/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Act 0: The Setup","type":"blogs"},{"content":"","date":"10 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"www.lugo-labs.com/blogs/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Blogs","type":"blogs"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;In the beginning\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThis is where it all starts â€” my commitment to building something real in cybersecurity.
