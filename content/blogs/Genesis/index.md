> *"In the beginning..."*

This is where it all starts — my commitment to building something real in cybersecurity. I'm coming at this not just as a student, but as a veteran, a father, and a believer.

Through this blog, I’ll document everything — the labs, the failures, the breakthroughs, the faith that grounds me, and the tools that sharpen me.

Welcome to Lugo Labs.
