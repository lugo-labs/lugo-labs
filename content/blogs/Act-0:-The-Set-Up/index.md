I chose Hugo for Lugo Labs because it’s ultra-lightweight, fast, and built on modern static site technology. As a static site generator, it gives me full control with minimal complexity — perfect for a portfolio-blog hybrid. It’s easy to configure and maintain, making it ideal for logging my projects and growth without distractions.

One of my favorite features is Hugo’s built-in responsiveness — it automatically adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices without me having to fuss with extra CSS or plugins. On top of that, it handles dynamic media and loads quickly across platforms.

For the theme, I picked **Blowfish** for its clean aesthetic and structure. It keeps the focus on content while giving me flexibility to style it the way I want. I’m building around a **Slate-inspired color palette** to reflect both the professional and technical edge of cybersecurity — sleek, dark, and focused.

This post marks the foundation of Lugo Labs — the platform I’ll use to share everything I break, build, and learn.
